Easy lamb stew:

Lamb mince (500g)
Potato (3-4 large)
Sweet Potato or Pumpkin (optional)
Carrots (4)
Onion (1)
Garlic (3-4 cloves or tablespoon crushed garlic)
Basil (teaspoon)
Coriander (half teaspoon)
Cumen (half teaspoon)
Salt, Pepper, Cinnamon, Nutmeg (to taste)

Cut all large ingredients into finger sized pieces.
Put everything together into large pot with half inch / 2 cm water. Cook on medium high heat for an hour. Keep an eye on liquid - at the end it should be slightly mushy but not dripping wet, nor dry.
If burns lightly, add a bit of water and stir pot bottom with wooden spoon.
