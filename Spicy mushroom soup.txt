Spicy mushroom soup
-------------------

This is based on an 'Irish' style stew, and a 500 g tin of such can save time. 

Use this recipe as a guide - the aim is to find flavours that work together by the time the cooking is done (flavours change over the cook time).


100 grams of beef or other meat cut to small cubes, sealed (on high temperature cooking surface) in a little oil in pot/pan.

3-5 litres of water in a pot, boil all ingredients for about 60 minutes

2-4 cups of diced mixed vegetables of your choice (example: carrots, peas, potato, corn, celery, spinach)

1-3 tablespoons minced garlic

4-10 large mushrooms, peeled, sliced (size doesn't actually matter).

1-2 tablespoons of capsicum / bell pepper (optional, ideally pickled)

1 tablespoon of milk (optional, to tone down the spices)

1 tablespoon of broccoli or broccolini, etc.

2 tablespoons pearl barley (optional, ideally pre-soaked for 2 hours or overnight)

Herbs (ideally fresh): 

1-2 tsp rosemary, finely chopped, (or other aromatic herbs)

1/8-1/4 tsp ground black pepper,

Salt according to taste,

1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

1/8-1/4 tsp chilis with seeds removed (unless you want it hot)

1-3 teaspoons of stock powder (optional, e.g. chicken flavour)

cook time: approx 40-90 minutes
