# recipes
A collection of international recipes (mostly mine) - written up at the time of cooking, either as a plan, or afterwards if it's liked.

If you're starting off cooking, start simple to build up your confidence, and ideally choose 1 recipe you like eating and learn to cook that well, then add more.
If you're overwhelmed and non-vegan, learn the different ways to cook an egg well. 
Use a sharp, safe knife. Wash things often if possible.
