2 cups yeast starter (if inactive with liquid on top, get rid of 2 cups leaving 1 cup, feed by adding 2 Tbsp wheat flour, 1 cup warm water, mix well with fork and leave 15 minutes in warm room/area or until bubbling well after a few minutes)
Self raising flour 2 cups
Rice flour 1 cup

Warm water as needed (1 cup)

Mix all dry ingredients in bowl
Add oil, yeast starter liquid, mix well. 
Add warm water as needed to form a dough (not dry or mushy, so you can pick up without it sticking)
Tablespoon flour on flat surface (to avoid sticking; too much flour dries out dough)
Knead vigorously until elastic (pulls back when stretched) and smooth when handling. 
Put in well greased/oiled bread tin.
Put in warm oven (about 40 degrees Celsius) for about 90 minutes or until rising slows down. 
Turn temperature up to 200 or so for 15-25 minutes to kill yeast, drop to 150 degrees for 5-20 minutes, poke with skewer or fork to ensure no dough sticks (cooked through).
